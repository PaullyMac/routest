<h1 align="center">Routest</h1>

## Overview

**Routest** is an AI-powered microservice for predictive route estimation that uses machine learning to analyze travel conditions, distances, and delivery-related factors to forecast the most optimal routes for logistics and transportation systems.

This project is designed as a modular system that combines:

- A backend ML API for predictive estimation
- A frontend interface for user interaction and route visualization
- Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development

## Coming Soon

- ML model training and evaluation
- API endpoints for prediction
- Interactive map-based frontend
- Possible Docker support for local development
